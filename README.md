# LanguageTestAutomation

## Description

This **Make** automation uploads personalized language tests to each student's individual Google Drive folder, which is automatically created when setting up their Google Classroom. It helps a private online language tutor reduce the time spent preparing lessons. The automation is programmed to upload a grammar test on a random topic to each student's folder every week. Since each student has a different proficiency level, the automation customizes the test content to match each student's individual level.

The test content is generated by a custom GPT assistant created on OpenAI's platform, which has been trained with extensive material covering various levels of English proficiency. This allows the automation to provide accurate and level-appropriate tests for each student.

## Custom GPT Assistant

The personalized tests are generated by a **custom GPT assistant** built using [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com). This assistant has been specifically trained with a large dataset of English language material, ranging from beginner to advanced levels, to ensure that each test is appropriately tailored to the student's proficiency. By leveraging this GPT assistant, the automation delivers highly customized grammar tests that match the learning needs of each student.

## Features

- Weekly automation of personalized tests.
- Integration with Google Sheets, a custom GPT assistant (via OpenAI), and Google Drive.
- Tailored test content based on each student's proficiency level.
- Automatic upload to each student's dedicated Google Drive folder linked to their Google Classroom.

## Installation

1. **Access to Make**:
   - In order to replicate or use this automation, you will need to have an account in Make.

2. **Import the flow**:
   - In Make, when creating a new scenario, you'll find a section called **Controls** with three dots ("..."). By clicking on it, you'll have the option to **import a JSON file**. You can use this option to import the flow that I've uploaded to the repository.

3. **Set up credentials**:
   - Since the API connections are personal, they cannot be shared for security reasons. You will need to set up your own credentials for:
     - **Google Sheets**: To manage student data and levels.
     - **OpenAI**: To use the custom GPT assistant for generating test content.
     - **Google Drive**: To upload the generated tests to each student's folder.

## Usage

- Tests are automatically uploaded to each student's dedicated Google Drive folder, which is linked to their Google Classroom.
- The flow is triggered weekly, ensuring that each student receives a personalized grammar test according to their proficiency level.

  - **Google Sheets**: To store and retrieve student data (names, proficiency levels, and the ID of the Google drive folder.).
  - **OpenAI**: To generate personalized test content using GPT.
  - **Google Drive**: To store and organize the tests in each student's folder.
